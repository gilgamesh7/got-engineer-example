Based on your requirements, we will need the following classes and functions:

1. `Game`: This class will represent the game itself. It will have methods to handle the game logic such as checking for a win or a draw, and updating the game state.

2. `Player`: This class will represent a player. It will have properties for the player's mark (nought or cross) and methods to make a move.

3. `GUI`: This class will handle the graphical user interface. It will have methods to draw the game board, update the display, and handle user input.

4. `main`: This function will be the entry point of the program. It will create instances of the `Game`, `Player`, and `GUI` classes and start the game loop.

Now, let's write the code for each of these components.
